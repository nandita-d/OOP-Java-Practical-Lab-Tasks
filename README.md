# OOP-Java-Practical-Lab-Tasks
This repository contains all the completed laboratory tasks for the Object-Oriented Programming in Java course. Each module’s tasks are systematically organized, well-documented, and implemented with proper coding practices.

Module 1: Fundamentals & Basic Programming
This module focuses on setting up the Java development environment and learning the fundamentals of Java programming. The objective is to write, compile, and execute basic programs while gaining an understanding of primitive data types, variables, and operators.



#Programs Implemented
HelloWorld.java

Prints "Hello, World!" along with a welcome message to verify the Java environment setup.

DataTypesDemo.java
Declares, initializes, and prints variables for all of Java’s primitive data typ
Includes optional tasks to perform basic arithmetic and logical operations.

#Key Concepts Covered
Environment Setup
.Installed Java Development Kit (JDK).
.Configured JAVA_HOME and updated the PATH environment variable.
.Compilation & Execution
