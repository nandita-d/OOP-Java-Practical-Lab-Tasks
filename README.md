# OOP-Java-Practical-Lab-Tasks
This repository contains all the completed laboratory tasks for the Object-Oriented Programming in Java course. Each module‚Äôs tasks are systematically organized, well-documented, and implemented with proper coding practices.

Module 1: Fundamentals & Basic Programming
This module focuses on setting up the Java development environment and learning the fundamentals of Java programming. The objective is to write, compile, and execute basic programs while gaining an understanding of primitive data types, variables, and operators.

Programs Implemented
HelloWorld.java

Prints "Hello, World!" along with a welcome message to verify the Java environment setup.

DataTypesDemo.java

Declares, initializes, and prints variables for all of Java‚Äôs primitive data types.

Includes optional tasks to perform basic arithmetic and logical operations.

Key Concepts Covered
Environment Setup

Installed Java Development Kit (JDK).

Configured JAVA_HOME and updated the PATH environment variable.

Compilation & Execution

Used javac to compile and java to run Java applications via the command line.

Data Types

Demonstrated all 8 primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

Operators

Implemented arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and logical (&&, ||, !) operators.

Version Control

Managed project history using Git.

Uploaded and maintained code in a GitHub repository.

How to Run (IntelliJ IDEA)
Open the Project

Launch IntelliJ IDEA.

Click File ‚Üí Open, then select the project folder.

Check JDK Setup

Go to File ‚Üí Project Structure ‚Üí Project.

Ensure the correct Project SDK (Java version) is selected.

Run the Program

In the Project panel, navigate to the Java file you want to run (e.g., HelloWorld.java).

Right-click the file and select Run 'HelloWorld.main()'.

The program output will appear in the Run window at the bottom of IntelliJ.

Re-run or Debug

Use the green Run (‚ñ∂) or Debug (üêû) icons on the toolbar to execute the program again.
